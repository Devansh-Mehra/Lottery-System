# Lottery-System
### In this project I have deployed the smart contract on the Ethereum BlockChain. It's a system in which  participants pay/ send some amount of ether at the price to buy lottery ticket to the manager and the total money deposited is set as the winners price. The winner is selected randomly also the participants can transfer more than once. The manager will have the full control of the lottery system
